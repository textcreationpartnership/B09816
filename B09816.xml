            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

This is laid as the ground and foundation of the whole cause. <hi>Charity,</hi> say they, <hi>is cold, and the people carelesse.</hi> But therefore hath God appointed Pastors and Ministers to oversee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the people, and not to suffer them to perish in their negligence. Were it a matter of tithes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther payment, the people should be called upon, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:184732:21"/> not suffered in any wise to be negligent, neither should their negligence stand for excuse; how much lesse should it be suffered when the case toucheth God?

The people is taught nothing, they understand nothing, they see nothing, neither comfort, nor memory of Christ, nor benefit of his passion. And this is the cause of their Negligence; therefore they stand thus back, and withdraw themselves: Howbeit what needeth Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> to charge the people with negligence and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184732:22"/> undevotion? THE POPE HIMSELF AND HIS CARDINALS DOE SCARCELY COMMUNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE ONCE IN A YEAR; BUT ARE AS NEG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGENT AND AS UNDEVOUT THEREIN AS THE MOST PART OF THE PEOPLE. Now let us view the weight of Mr. <hi>Hardings</hi> reasons. <hi>The people is negligent and undevout,</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Priest may say Masse alone.</hi> This Argument is very weak. So might Mr <hi>Harding</hi> say, <hi>The people will not hear the word of God,</hi> Ergo. <hi>The Priest may goe into the Pulpit and preach alone.

But what ill luck is this, that they whom Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten condemneth for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> CAN BE SO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOUT, AND HE AND HIS CATHOLICKS THUS REMAIN WITHOUT DEVOTION? Let the people be taught; let them hear the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration in their own tongue, that they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the holy mysteries, and feel comfort and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the same; let them see examples of diligence in the Clergy, then will they be no longer negligent: then should M. <hi>Hard.</hi> perforce give over his private Mass, as seeing the whole right of his cause hangeth only of the negligence, and mis-doing of the people.<note n="[t]" place="margin">
